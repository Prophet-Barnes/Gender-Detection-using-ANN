# Gender-Detection-using-ANN
The objective of this project was to perform EDA and clean the provided dataset and build a neural network architecture, which could predict the gender of a twitter user based on various factors like the user's activity and profile type. 
The model created using TensorFlow retains the best epoch in a folder by the name 'best_one' and uses it later while predicting for the testing data.
